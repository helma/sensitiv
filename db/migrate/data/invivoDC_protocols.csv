"Protocol Description","Tonsils were minced in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) supplemented with 0.2% gentamicin (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and the tissue was digested with 2 mg/ml collagenase IV and 100 U/ml  DnaseI for 15 min in room temperature. Released cells were filtered through 70 mm nylon cell strainers (Falcon, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and washed once in gentamicin-supplemented RPMI 1640. Mononuclear cells were isolated fby Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation. T lymphocytes were depleted by rosetting with sheep erythrocytes treated with neuraminidase (Sigma-Aldrich). Further depletion of B cells, T cells and monocytes was performed by magnetic separation, using anti-CD19, anti-CD3 and anti-CD14-coated beads (Dynal Biotech A.S, Oslo, Norway). Negatively selected cells enriched for DCs were incubated with FITC-conjugated mAbs against CD3 (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA), CD14 and CD19 (DakoCytomation A/S, Glostrup, Denmark), APC-conjugated anti-HLA-DR (BD Bioscience) and either PE-conjugated mAb against BDCA3 (Miltenyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) or CD123 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). BDCA1+ DCs were incubated with a lineage specific PE-labeled antibody cocktail (DakoCytomation A/S), HLA-DR-APC (BD Bioscience) and BDCA1-FITC (Miltenyi Biotech). Lineage negative and HLA-DRhigh DCs, positive for either BDCA1, BDCA3 or CD123 were then sorted on a FACSDiVa or a FACSAria (BD Bioscience) and collected in tubes containing 1 ml of 100% fetal bovine serum. 40.000-100.000 cells of each unique DC population were isolated. ","Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from leukocyte-enriched buffycoats (Lund University Hospital) by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation. Deletion of T-, B- and red blood cells, labelling and sorting were performed as described in P-DCextrtonsil with the additional staining of CD16 positive cells using PE-conjugated CD16 mAb (BD Bioscience), followed by sorting.","Standard Affymetrix GeneChip protocol was used. https://www.affymetrix.com/support/downloads/manuals/expression_s2_manual.pdf","Affymetrix GeneChip® Two-Cycle Target Labeling Assay was used. http://www.affymetrix.com/products/reagents/specific/two_cycle_target_control.affx","The Human U133A arrays were used, produced by Affymetrix inc."

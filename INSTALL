apt-get install 
	sqlite3
	java-jdk
	libsqlite3-dev
	ruby >= 1.8.4

gem install 
	rjb 

We experienced problems on Ubuntu with ruby 1.8.5 repository version. Had to install ruby 1.8.6 and rubygems 0.9.4 manually.

If you use SSL to secure the server, add the following iptables rule to avoid direct connections to port 8000 (from the outside only):
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8000 -i ! lo -j REJECT

copy public/file_document
copy/create db/development.sqlite3
set JAVA_HOME (/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.5.0-sun) in config/environment.rb
rake opentox:compile_java

#gem install xml-simple
#gem install rcdk
set JAVA_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH before starting mongrel
/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/mongrel_rails start -p 8000 -e production
install libapache2-mod-proxy-html
enable proxies in apache
 a2enmod proxy
 a2enmod proxy_http
 a2enmod headers
configure apache
	Check that you have something like this in your httpd.conf:

	<Proxy *>
		Order allow,deny
		Allow from all
	</Proxy>

	In Debian and Ubuntu, this is set to deny by default in /etc/apache2/mods-available/proxy.conf. 

	On Debian etch (and Ubuntu) look at /etc/apache2/mods-available/proxy.conf:


	AddDefaultCharset off
	Order deny,allow
	Deny from all
	#Allow from .example.com

	Rather than override that, add this to your Mongrel cluster proxy definition (along with the 127.0.0.1 lines:


	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all

	Problem solved

before starting Webbrick (mongrel also??) (setting in environment.rb does not help)
